                        I am creating this website to showcase the projects I have created over the years.
                        This website uses react (jsx) and sass (scss) and is the first (non-tutorial) website I have created.
                        This website is also not quite finished. I have many animations and pages setup that I currently working to fix or create and will soon push those changes once finished.
                        The source code for this website can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ThousandAllen/PortfolioWebsite">here. </a>
                    </p>
                </div>           
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
