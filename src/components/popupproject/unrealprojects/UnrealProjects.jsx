            To learn Unreal Engine 4 and blender, I created several small projects.
            Some projects I created for game development marathons, and are complete games.
            Other projects I created were never intended to be games, as their only purpose was to help me learn how to program in Unreal Engine or learn the basics to art in Unreal Engine.
