                    During the Summer of 2022, I participated in the TMU Thrill Design Competition, where we created a ride using No Limits 2, Blender, SolidWorks, and other software.
                    We were accepted to attend the invitational (presented by Universal Creative) in the fall at Universal Studios Orlando. We learned about ride design, ASTM F24 standards, and designed rides
                    in a marathon-type style (create each ride within ~24 hours).After the TMU Thrill Design Compeitition Invitational, I attended IAAPA 2022. 
                    I had the oppoortunity to talk to themed entertainment professionals and learn more about the industry.
